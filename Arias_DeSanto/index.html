    <p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
        I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
        She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
        In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
        Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
        Didn't make sense not to live for fun
        Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
        So much to do, so much to see
        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
        You'll never know if you don't go
        You'll never shine if you don't glow
        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
        Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
        And all that glitters is gold
        Only shooting stars break the mold
        It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
        You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
        But the meteor men beg to differ
        Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
        The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
        The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
        My world's on fire, how about yours?
        That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
        Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
        All that glitters is gold
        Only shooting stars break the mold
        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
        Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
        And all that glitters is gold
        Only shooting stars
        Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
        I need to get myself away from this place
        I said, "Yup" what a concept
        I could use a little fuel myself
        And we could all use a little change
        Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
        Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
        Didn't make sense not to live for fun
        Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
        So much to do, so much to see
        So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
        You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
        You'll never shine if you don't glow
        Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
        Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
        And all that glitters is gold
        Only shooting stars break the mold
        And all that glitters is gold
        Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
